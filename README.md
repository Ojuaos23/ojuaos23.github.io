The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) deployment link is available upon request as part of the technical deep-dive.

☁️ Multicloud Deployment Architecture

This project was intentionally deployed across two different cloud platforms to demonstrate proficiency in diverse deployment workflows, cloud static hosting configuration, and file structure management (key skills for any Cloud Engineer).

Hosting Platform

Purpose & Skill Demonstrated
Status
GitHub Pages
Primary hosting platform for speed, custom domain mapping, and continuous integration.
✅ Primary Live Host

OCI Object Storage
Demonstrated ability to configure Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage for static website hosting, including file renaming (resume website.html to index.html) and public bucket configuration.
✅ Secondary Deployment Artifact

🛠️ Key Technologies & Skills Demonstrated

Category: Skills & Tools Used

Front-End: HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Design (Mobile-first approach)

Cloud Hosting: GitHub Pages, OCI Object Storage (Public Bucket Configuration)

Version Control: Git, GitHub (Commit history, branch management, web interface deployment)

File Management: Debugged and resolved critical issues related to web server file-naming conventions (index.html) and relative file pathing (/assets/, /images/).
